<!--I had a lot of fun making this, so I made 3 different pages with links in the header!  I also used .css
    files to make the pictures smaller and to change the background color.  I used google gemini to help me figure out how to use a class attribute
    on an image to allow me to edit the size!-->

            <p>
                My name is Ethan Jensen and I love music and technology!  I play the piano, viola, and the electric guitar!
                I also love playing video games and reading books.
                Some of my favorite games are most classic nintendo games like Marion Kart and the Legend of Zelda franchise!
                I also built my own tower computer and I love to play a lot of PC games using mouse and keyboard!
                I don't have a ton of coding experience, but I love using technology and I'm super excited to learn more about
                how the world of devices and tech works! 
            </p>
        <h2>My Family</h2>
            <p>I'm from Meridian, Idaho and I grew up there basically my whole life!  
                I have an older sister, an older brother, a younger brother, and a younger sister!
                So yeah, I'm the exact middle child!
                We don't have a family dog or cat at home, but we do have 2 bunny rabbits.
